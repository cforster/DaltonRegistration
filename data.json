In reading these texts, with their varied literary and historical representations of race in the United States, we recognize from the start that there is no fixed body of African American literary \u201cmasterpieces\u201d; rather, the texts we will study are very much involved in the question/debate of just what should an African American literature be (and, in turn, just what should we mean by negro/black/afro/African American). The course then will pay particular attention to the cultural work of African American literature, and the ways in which that literature has shifted and left an indelible mark on American literature and culture.  And in doing so, we will situate each work in its aesthetic, social, historical, and ideological context.Among many questions, we will consider: What, if anything, is common to African-American literature and culture?  Does this literature have a distinct social purpose? What are the artistic values of African- American literature?  How do gender and sexuality play into notions or definitions of Blackness? How does literacy dovetail with freedom, citizenship and power?  How do African-American writers speak to each other? Works include writers such as: Wright, Baldwin, Morrison, Fuller, Locke, and Reed.", "gradesOffered": "12", "courseName": "African-American Literature", "preapprovalRequired": false, "rankType": null, "corequisite": "", "prerequisite": ""}}, {"pk": 512, "model": "registrationApp.course", "fields": {"courseCredit": "Full Year Course, 1 credit", "courseDescription": "The Invention  of ModernityStudents in the tenth grade will continue their focus on the making of the modern world, and an in-depth analysis of the Constitution of the United States of America serves as our point of departure.

We will consider the basic ideas of modern philosophers who have concerned themselves with these questions.We will consider key arguments made by David Hume, G. E. Moore, and Alisdair MacIntyre in the Fall semester, and then look at the ethics of Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Susan Wolf, Richard Rorty and Emmanuel Levinas in the Spring.  Students will concentrate on learning how to read these difficult texts\u2014which means learning how to be precise with language and how to test that language against concrete examples\u2014as well as on the substantive questions raised.Thursdays 6:30-8:30pmOpen to 11th and 12th graders (and 10th graders with permission of instructor)T. deZengotita", "gradesOffered": "12", "courseName": "Modern Ethics Since The Death Of God", "preapprovalRequired": false, "rankType": null, "corequisite": "", "prerequisite": ""}}, {"pk": 894, "model": "registrationApp.course", "fields": {"courseCredit": "", "courseDescription": "We live in a world of dangerous ideas that threaten to change the world as we know it. In this term\u2019s seminar in Applied Ethics we will evaluate these powerful ideas and their impact on current issues in our society. There will be four units to this course: Foundations of Morality; Violence (Causes and Prevention); the Future of Marriage; and Designer Babies. Here are some of the questions that we will discuss:1.   Is there a basis for morality, and, if so, what are its foundations? Is there any reason to prefer one system of morals over another?2.   Is most violence perpetuated by people not so different from us? Do we have the free will tomake any choices in our lives? Is punishment ever justifiable?3.   Is the Institution of Marriage just a quaint remnant from a by-gone era that should no longer be supported by state recognition and financial benefits? Who gets to decide: the legislature, thecourts or each of us for our self?4.   Should we use biological technology to design \u201cbetter\u201d children?Our readings will include newspaper and magazine articles, cases, and excerpts from books by contemporary experts and great thinkers of the past such as: Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, Steven Pinker, Robert Wright, Jonathan Glover, Joshua Greene, Stanley Milgram, and Michael Sandel.Tuesday Afternoons from 3:45 to 5:45\t\tand Thomas Berner Wendela315@hotmail.com", "gradesOffered": "11", "courseName": "Interschool Seminar - Advanced Topics in Applied Ethics: Dangerous Ideas", "preapprovalRequired": false, "rankType": null, "corequisite": "", "prerequisite": "No prerequisites.

Readings are taken from Marshall McLuhan\u2019s Understanding  Media, Walter Ong\u2019s Orality and Literacy, Neil Postman\u2019sAmusing Ourselves to Death, Henry Jenkins\u2019 Convergence Culture, Sherry Turkle\u2019s Life on the Screen,and Thomas de Zengotita\u2019s Mediated.\tThe aim is to familiarize students with the basic argument\u2014namely, that media themselves can have hidden psycho-cultural effects as significant as the more obvious effects of content.  For example, McLuhan argued that the sheer experience of reading and writing was one of the conditions that shaped modern individualism because it helped people create an \u201cinner space\u201d for ongoing conversation with themselves. Hence the importance of literacy for Bible reading Protestants whose personal relationship to God defined the Reformation. Is it a coincidence that journals and diaries flourished during the same period?The second semester will be devoted to student research projects on contemporary media. Topics might include the use of applications like texting and Facebook\u2014do they simply make public what used to be private, or do they also constitute a buffer zone between us?  How have films like The Matrix and Avatar, on the one hand, and reality shows like American Idol and Jersey Shore, on the other, influenced the way we conceive of \u201creality\u201d in the first place?  People between the ages of 8 and 18 spend more time in front of screens of some kind than any other activity\u2014except sleeping.  Does that mean they are avoiding reality? Or does it mean that \u201creality\u201d has changed?
